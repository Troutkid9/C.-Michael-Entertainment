          <p>I guess you want some sort of backstory, well here we go!</p>
          <p>
            During this dark time, many of the galaxy's best fighters from the past and the future have come to duke it out and see who the galaxy's best fighter is... 
          </p>
          <p>On top of all the prominent fighters, Master Jedi Craig, and his powerful padawan, Cl√©mence, are joining the fighting as well.</p>
          
          <p>I tried to include Leia, however she decided she would keep declining my calls...</p>
          
          <p>Now that this backstory is over you'll have to chase the play button before it dissapears, since I was too lazy to animate it moving longer and wanted to force you to have to read all of this...</p>
          
          <p>Anyways, my time is up, so I'll see you on the battle field, good luck! And may the Force be with you...</p>
